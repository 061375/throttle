This was in response to a problem a customer was experiencing. Their server was running out of memory. They were filtering applications 
based on specific criteria and didn't know that the applications were being spammed. This throttle ... didn't work as the applications
were being fed by a seemingly unlimited list of IP addresses. 
Other methods were necessary. I was eventually able to fix the issue. This simple solution will probably work in most instances though.
